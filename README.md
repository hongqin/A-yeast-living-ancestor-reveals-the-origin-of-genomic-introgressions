# Manuscript
This folder contains main figures and supplementary figures, supplementary tables and source data files underlying each plot. The alignment used to build figure 1a is provided in the genome assemblies and annotations folder.


# Sequence data
Sequence data for the strains belonging to the Alpechin, Brazilian bioethanol, Mexican agave and French Guyana clades were part of another study and were previously submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) NCBI under the accession number ERP014555. The genome sequences generated in this study are available at Sequence Read Archive (SRA), NCBI under the accession codes BioProject ID PRJNA594913, Biosample ID SAMN13540515 - SAMN13540586.


# Genome assemblies and annotations
This folder contains genome assemblies of the living ancestor based on short- (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio) sequencing. A complete annotation of the Illumina-based genome assembly is also provided. The alignment used to build the phylogenetic tree in figure 1a is provided in this folder.

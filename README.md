# Manuscript
This folder contains main figures and supplementary figures, supplementary tables and source data files underlying each plot. The alignment used to build figure 1a is available upon request.


# Sequence data
Sequence data for the strains belonging to the Alpechin, Brazilian bioethanol, Mexican agave and French Guyana clades were part of another study and were previously submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) NCBI under the accession number ERP014555. The genome sequences generated in this study are available at Sequence Read Archive (SRA), NCBI under the accession codes BioProject ID PRJNA594913, Biosample ID SAMN13540515 - SAMN13540586.


# Sequencing and de novo assembly of the living ancestor’s genome
This folder contains genome assemblies of the living ancestor based on short- (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio) sequencing.


# Mapping LOH and introgressions’ boundaries
This folder contains the reference genomes used in this paragraph of the manuscript, their subtelomeric coordinates and a list of reliable markers used to define loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) regions in the living ancestor and introgression regions in the Alpechin, Brazilian bioethanol, Mexican agave and French Guyana clades. Pan-introgression maps for all the clades are also provided.


# Variant calling and SNVs analysis
This folder contains the reference genome used in this paragraph of the manuscript, as well as a list of heterozygous de novo mutations present in the living ancestor's S. paradoxus and S. cerevisiae LOH blocks. Tables indicating the allele present at each of these sites for all the Alpechin strains and the 25 living ancestor's gametes are also provided. Additional files contain the list of alleles present in the S. paradoxus and the S. cerevisiae haplotypes of the living ancestor's genome.


# Estimation of the living ancestor's base substitution rate and phenotypic impact
This folder contains a list of de novo mutations occurred during the return-to-growth (RTG) and mutation accumulation lines (MAL) experiments. 


# Molecular dating of genome instability and Alpechin emergence
The list of synonymous sites used for the estimation based on the strict molecular clock model is provided, along with the fasta sequences used for the estimation based on the random, local molecular clock model.


# GO term analysis and annotation of LOH and introgressed genes
We provide a complete list of introgressed genes present in the Alpechin, Brazilian bioethanol, Mexican agave and French Guyana clades.
